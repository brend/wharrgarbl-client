  <p>The rules are the same as the famous game Wordle by Josh Wardle, with some changes:</p>
  <p><em>No duplicate letters allowed</em>, i.e. FLOAT is ok, FLEET is not</p>
  <p>You may <em>guess as often as you like</em></p>
  <p>Letters that do not appear in the word are <span class="no"><b>gray</b></span>, letters that do appear but are in the wrong place are <span class="elsewhere"><b>yellow</b></span>, and letters that are already in the correct place are <span class="yes"><b>green</b></span>.</p>
